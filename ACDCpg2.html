    <h2 style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION OF ANGOLO COMUNNITY DEVELOPMENT CENTRE (ACDC)</h2>

    <div>

      <h3>1. Founding leadership</h3>
      <p>
        Propelled by her Christian faith, Dorcas Hildah Obonde founded Ang’olo
        Mennonite Church Congregation at Ang’olo Village of the then SIAYA
        District in 1982. On founding the congregation, Dorcas formed an
        Ang’olo
        Church Development Committee (ACDC) to facilitate a wholistic church
        work.
        Working with this committee DORCAS proceeded to establish an Ang’olo
        Christian Development Centre (ACDC) on a three (3) acre piece of Land
        set
        aside by her husband (JASON OBONDE) for that purpose. In their quest for
        a

        wholistic Christian development Dorcas and Jason established an Ang’olo
        Community Development Centre (ACDC) on the land and constructed; - a
        Community service hall, Water tank and Poultry house.

        In 1988 the Late Dorcas Hildah Obonde mobilized a
        group of women and formed a Self-Help Group called
        Ang’olo Women Group (AWG). The Initiative was later
        registered as a CBO aimed at poverty eradication and
        better livelihood among the poor rural families of
        Ang’olo Village of MADIANY DIVISION. In between
        1988 to 1995 the CBO undertook among other things:-
        <br>• Mobilization and recruitment of members for self-help group development
        activities.
        <br>• Environmental conservation practices through development of tree
        nurseries and promotion of Agro-forestry
        <br>• Income generating activities (IGAs) for group members through Crop
        husbandry and rabbit keeping projects
        <br>• Promotion of a revolving Women Savings and Credit Scheme linked with
        Women Entrepreneurship
        <br>• Purchase of a canoe and launching a Fishing Business In 1996, Dorcas
        Initiative acquired a new legal status as ACDC, a Not-for-Profit entity
        registered under Companies Act, Cap 486 with strict Charitable Articles of
        Association. The organization has since evolved through different phases
        over the years to a cross-national development facilitator with its
        Management Secretariat (Head office) transferred from the village to
        Nairobi’s Central Business District, Baghwanji Building, 2nd Floor of
        Biashara Street in Nairobi.

      <p>
        Under the leadership of National Programs Coordinator, Ms Pamela Amoiya
        Obonde, ACDC’s
        expanded strategy and catchment’s scope necessitated organizational
        restructuring into two
        programmatic focus areas namely:-
        <br>2.1 Capacity Building Program (CBP) – (Skills’ tapping IGA/Sustainability
        Initiative). CBP is the
        strategic long-term financier to the Women Development Programs.
        <br>2.2 Women Development Program (WDP) – (socio-economic development
        focusing on children, Youth and Women). The WDP has since
        mobilized,
        promoted and established several CBOs with whom
        the organization is implementing the following
        programs among others:-
        <br>• Women empowerment towards the abandonment
        of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)/FEM among
        the Maasai communities
        <br>• Women empowerment towards engagement in
        sustainable economic development initiatives.
        In this endeavor ACDC has purchased a plot and
        established a Women Business Centre in Saikeri of
        Kajiado District.
        <br>• Promotion and acceleration of education of the
        Girl-child
        <br>• Rescue, rehabilitation and empowerment of
        domestic child workers and girls in FEM.
        <br>• HIV AIDs prevention and sexual /reproductive
        health interventions.
        <br>• Rescue, rehabilitation, empowerment and support
        of the at-risk Youth.
